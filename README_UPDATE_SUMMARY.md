# README Update Summary

## Changes Made to Correct Documentation

### ✅ Corrected Control System Descriptions

**Before:**
- "Dual PID Controllers for temperature and humidity"
- References to humidity PID tuning commands
- Incorrect AutoTune references for humidity

**After:**
- "Temperature PID Controller with AutoTune capability"
- "Humidity Hysteresis Control using digital on/off switching"
- Clear distinction between temperature (PID) and humidity (hysteresis) control

### ✅ Added Current Implementation Status

Added new section documenting what's actually implemented:
- ✅ Temperature Control: Full PID with AutoTune
- ✅ Humidity Control: Digital hysteresis control
- ✅ Interface System: 5-screen LCD interface
- ✅ Device Discovery: Automatic I2C detection
- ✅ Configuration: Multi-tier JSON system
- ✅ Dew Point Compensation: Cooling limitation

### ✅ Updated Configuration Examples

**Corrected:**
- Removed non-existent humidity PID parameters
- Added humidity hysteresis configuration
- Updated AutoTune examples to show temperature-only

### ✅ Fixed Future Enhancements Section

**Updated:**
- Marked Temperature AutoTune as ✅ COMPLETED
- Marked Interface System as ✅ COMPLETED  
- Removed references to humidity AutoTune (not applicable)

### ✅ Enhanced Usage Guide

**Added:**
- Detailed Interface system navigation instructions
- Clear explanation of 5-screen system
- Distinction between temperature PID and humidity hysteresis operation
- Automatic settings persistence documentation

### ✅ Technical Accuracy Improvements

**Corrected:**
- Diagnostic command outputs
- Control method descriptions
- Mode selection explanations
- System architecture accuracy

## Key Technical Clarifications

1. **Temperature Control**: Uses advanced PID with AutoTune capability
2. **Humidity Control**: Uses simple digital on/off with hysteresis (no PID needed)
3. **Interface**: Complete 5-screen system with rotary encoder navigation
4. **AutoTune**: Only available for temperature (humidity doesn't need it)
5. **Configuration**: Automatic persistence to ClimateConfig.json

The README now accurately reflects the actual implementation without any misleading references to non-existent humidity PID functionality.
